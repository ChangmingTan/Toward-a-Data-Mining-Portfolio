# Toward-a-Data-Mining-Portfolio

<h3> Project description </h3>

Ensemble classification: This project involves generating several classification models for the same data set and then combining the output from the models in an ensemble fashion.   R files are provided that generates classification models using different data sets.  You will want use this to develop a heterogeneous ensemble classifier for the BreastCancer data set which is provided.  You will want to add code that combines the output from the different models using Majority rule ensemble approach.
Part of your Data Mining Portfolio: This assignment involves developing data mining model for classification using the heterogeneous ensemble approach.  This can be used in developing your data mining portfolio
